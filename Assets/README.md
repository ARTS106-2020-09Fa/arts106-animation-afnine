# 2020-AnimationBasics
 
The cube senses threat and makes a sneaky leap towards the right after anticipating. Then the cube compresses itself horizontally before making a small jump out of fear. Finally the cube settles down slowly and softly.

The animation principles I attempted to portray were anticipation, squash and stretch, and staging.

I attempted to make the cube look nervous/frightened.
